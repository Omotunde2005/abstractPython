The Vat API can be used to calculate VATs on goods, validate a company's VAT number, and get the latest VAT rates for product categories in a country.
In `abstract-python`, the `VatAPI` class is used to communicate with this API.

## Supported currency codes
AbstractAPI supports ISO 4217 currency codes for the VAT API which can be found [here](https://docs.abstractapi.com/vat-validation#country-codes)


## Get currency codes

With `abstract-python` you can get the supported country codes as a Python List. See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python import VAT_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES

print(VAT_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES)
```

Below is the result: 

```python
>>> [
    "AT", "BE", "BG", "CY", "CZ", "DE", "DK", "EE", "EL", "ES", "FI", "FR", "HR",
    "HU", "IR", "IT", "LT", "LU", "LV", 
    "MT", "NL", "PL", "PT", "RO", "SE", "SI", "SK", "XI",
    ]
```

### Use case

If your app receives country codes from users, you may need to validate these inputs before querying the `VatAPI` class. 

See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python import VAT_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES

country_code = input("Enter a country code")

if country code in VAT_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES:
    # continue with the app logic
else:
    print(f"{country_code} is not a supported country code")
```

The code above is a simple console-based program. This technique can also be extended to other programs such as a web app or desktop app.
