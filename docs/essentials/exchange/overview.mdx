The Exchange Rates API can be used to get real time exchange rates, past/historical rates, and quick currency conversion betwwen currencies.
It supports 80+ currencies. In `abstract-python`, the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class is used to communicate with this API.

## Supported currency codes

AbstractAPI supports ISO 4217 currency codes which can be found [here](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates#currency-codes-of-supported-currencies)


## Get currency codes programmatically

With `abstract-python` you can get the supported currency codes as a Python List. See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python.abstract import CURRENCY_CODES

print(CURRENCY_CODES)
```

### Result
```python
>>> ["AF", "AL", "DZ", "AS", "AD", "AO", "AI", "AG", "AR", "AM", "AW", "AU",
    "AT", "AZ", "BH", "BD", "BB", "BY", "BE", "BZ", "BJ", "BM", "BT", "BO",
    "BA", "BW", "BR", "VG", "BN", "BG", "BF", "BI", "CV", "KH", "CM", "CA",
    "KY", "CF", "TD", "CL", "CN", "CO", "KM", "CG", "CD", "CK", "CR", "CI"]
```

## Use case

If your Python app allows users to enter currency codes independently, you may need to validate user inputs before querying the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class. 

See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python.abstract import CURRENCY_CODES

base_currency = input("Enter a currency code")

if base_currency in CURRENCY_CODES:
    print("Yes")
```
