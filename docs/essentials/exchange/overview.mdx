The Exchange Rates API can be used to get real time exchange rates, past/historical rates, and quick currency conversion betwwen currencies.
It supports 80+ currencies. In `abstract-python`, the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class is used to communicate with this API.

## Supported currency codes

AbstractAPI supports ISO 4217 currency codes which can be found [here](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates#currency-codes-of-supported-currencies)


## Get currency codes

With `abstract-python` you can get the supported currency codes as a Python List. See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python.abstract import EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES

print(EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES)
```

### Result
```python
>>> [
    "ARS", "AUD", "BCH", "BGN", "BNB", "BRL", "BTC", "CAD", "CHF", "CNY", 
    "CYP", "CZK", "DKK", "DOGE", "DZD", "EEK", "ETH", "EUR", "GBP", "GRD", 
    "HKD", "HRK", "HUF", "IDR", "ILS", "INR", "ISK", "JPY", "KRW", "LTC", 
    "LTL", "LVL", "MAD", "MTL", "MXN", "MYR", "NOK", "NZD", "PHP", "PLN", 
    "RON", "RUB", "SEK", "SGD", "SIT", "SKK", "THB", "TRY", "TWD", "USD", 
    "XRP", "ZAR"
    ]
```

## Use case

If your Python app allows users to enter currency codes themselves, you may need to validate user inputs before querying the `ExchangeRatesAPI` class. 

See usage below:

```python
from abstract_python.abstract import EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES

base_currency = input("Enter a currency code")

if base_currency in EXCHANGE_SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES:
    # Query an endpoint in the ExchangeRatesAPI class 
```
