## Overview

The `abstract-python` library is a Python wrapper for APIs by [AbstractAPI](https://www.abstractapi.com/). It contains helper classes
that allow Python developers use these APIs without worrying about the endpoints. 

It also does type validation on each request before they aresent to the API server. This helps to prevent wastage of credits, since each API request to the server counts; 
whether successful or otherwise. 

The library currrently supports the Exchange Rates API, IP Geolocation API, and the VAT API.

<Note>
    This is not an official library by the team @AbstractAPI. It is an open source project and not intended for profit-making. It is safe to use
    by anyone.

## Responses

All responses are returned as a JSON object. Each response has a `status` field to verify the request success. Below is a sample response for a successful request:

```python

{
  // Other response data
  "status": 200
}
```

## Errors

Errors in `abstract-python` are in two(2) variants.

- **Regular Python exceptions:** 

A common exception you will encounter is the `TypeError`, usually from wrong data types submitted as arguments.

- **JSON error messages:**

These are JSON objects with detailed description of the error. They are often self-explanatory.
Below is a sample error message:

```python
// Authorization error

{
  "error": {
    "message":"A validation error occurred.",
    "code":"validation_error",
    "details":{
      "api_key":["This field may not be blank."],
      "country_code":["\"fu\" is not a valid choice."]
    }
  },
  "status": 401
}
```
