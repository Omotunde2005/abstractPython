## Overview

The `abstract-python` library is a Python SDK for APIs by [AbstractAPI](https://www.abstractapi.com/). It contains helper classes
that allow Python developers use these APIs without having to know the endpoints off-hand. 

It also does type validation on each query before they are sent to the API server. This prevents credits wastage since each query deducts a credit - 
whether successful or otherwise. 

This SDK currrently supports the **[Exchange Rates API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/exchange-rates)**, 
**[IP Geolocation API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation)**, and the **[VAT API](https://docs.abstractapi.com/vat-validation)**.

<Note>
    This is not an official SDK by AbstractAPI. It is an open source project and safe to use by anyone.

## Format for responses

All responses are returned as a `JSON` object. Each response has a `status` field to verify the request success. Below is a sample response for a successful request:

```python

{
  // Other response data
  "status": 200
}
```

## Errors and exceptions

Errors in `abstract-python` are in two(2) variants.

- **Regular Python exceptions:** 

A common exception you will encounter is the `TypeError`, usually from wrong data types used in arguments.

- **JSON error messages:**

These are JSON objects with detailed description of the error. They are often self-explanatory.
Below is a sample error message:

```python
// Authorization error

{
  "error": {
    "message":"A validation error occurred.",
    "code":"validation_error",
    "details":{
      "api_key":["This field may not be blank."],
      "country_code":["\"fu\" is not a valid choice."]
    }
  },
  "status": 401
}
```
More details on errors are provided in each API section.
